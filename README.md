"Runes For Mempool" is a Chrome extension designed specifically for Bitcoin's Mempool. It allows users to view content related to the [Runes Protocol](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes/specification.html) within the Mempool, including etchings, mints, edicts, and pointers found in RuneStone. Additionally, it allows for the viewing of the Cenotaph, an element within the Runes Protocol. "Runes For Mempool" upgrades the 'OP_RETURN' operation, which typically appears as empty data in the Mempool, to display meaningful content from the Runes Protocol. As an essential component for processing Bitcoin transactions, the "Runes For Mempool" makes navigating the Mempool more convenient.
